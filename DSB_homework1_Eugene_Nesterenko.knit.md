# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

    -   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
    -   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
    -   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
    -   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    -   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    -   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

We have found an unusual result for the *Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late* filter. It must be the case of currupted data - we can hardly imagine flights that spent more than additional 1000 minutes in the air (arrival time delay was over 1000 minutes with non-positive departure delay)

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

<!-- -->

    flights %>% 
      filter(is.na(dep_time))

February has **the highest** proportion of cancelled flights (5.1%), while October has **the lowest** (0.8%). **Our hypothesis is that in February weather conditions in NYC often do not permit the plane to take off** (cold weather, ice on the runway, blizzard). Same factors could contribute to higher average delay time (though this hypothesis needs to be verified).

**For October-November** (percentage is similar), **perhaps, weather conditions are most favourable.** We also see the **seasonal factor only for autumn months (September - November), which indicates low percentage of cancelled flights**. Other seasons do not show a clear pattern.

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

The unconditioned arrangement shows that plane **N725MQ** has the highest number of flights, 575.

However, if we apply the filter on number of seats (*more than 50*), the result changes: now **N328AA** tops the list with 393 flights. The data frame **frequent_flyer_destinations** shows the destinations to which plane with tail number N328AA flew in 2013 - as expected, it has 393 rows.

We have tried to make a code more robust, saving the variable (list) for most frequent flyer and later applying as an input for flights filter. If the dataset changes, so might change the tail number of most frequent flyer - the code supports such case.

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
    -   What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
    -   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?

**Temperature in July 2013 has a mean of 80 degrees Fahrenheit and a standard deviation of 7.1**. It also **seems to be skewed to the right**, with median (79 degrees) being less than mean, and 75% percentile and maximum value farther from median than 25% percentile and minimum value respectively.

**Wind speed data seems to be incomplete in July 2013, with 2 missing points and as much as 79 points with wind speed of exactly 0** (unlikely result, looks more like lack of data than true case of 0 speed).

The scatter plot for the (dewp, humid) looks quite cumbersome, but from the shape **we can infer a positive correlation - the higher the dew point, the higher the humidity.** We believe these are related concepts (but not so sure on the definitions), so the correlation is expected.

The **precipitation-visibility** data shows no clear pattern on individual observations across years, and July 2013 data points to **slightly positive correlation**. This is **counterintuitive**, as we would expect rain and snow to reduce distance at which objects are visible.

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

    -   How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
    -   What are the five most common manufacturers?
    -   Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)

Table *planes* only contains information about year of manufacture. Applying the NA filter, we find that 70 planes have unknown year of manufacture.

The list of five most common manufacturer is provided below. Boeing tops the list with 1630 planes

| Manufacturer     | Number of planes |
|------------------|------------------|
| BOEING           | 1630             |
| AIRBUS INDUSTRIE | 400              |
| BOMBARDIER INC   | 368              |
| AIRBUS           | 336              |
| EMBRAER          | 299              |

: Common manufacturers

We need to be aware, however, that grouping by might not recognize same manufacturer under different names (e.g. "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE" is treated separate from "AIRBUS"). To take this into account, manufacturer names in the dataset must be amended to be uniform. The hint on "case_when" might also be useful.

Indeed, applying the case_when and grouping all manufactures with less than 10 planes into the "OTHER" category, we get the top-5 manufacturers:

| Manufacturer      | Number of planes |
|-------------------|------------------|
| BOEING            | 1630             |
| AIRBUS            | 736              |
| BOMBARDIER INC    | 368              |
| EMBRAER           | 299              |
| MCDONNELL DOUGLAS | 237              |

Others total in 52 planes

The general idea to understand changes in 2013 is the following:

1.  Find and save a distinct list of unique planes that flew in 2013 (tailnum from flights table)
2.  Use this list as an input to %in% filter for the planes_renamed_manufacturers table
3.  Group the dataframe by manufacturer, summarize (count) and arrange in descending order

However, tibble from point 1 (list of unique planes) does not serve as a filter input well, and we don't know how to actually save variable as a list (vector)

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
    -   How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?

N381AA is the oldest plane (manufactured in 1956) that flew from NYC in 2013. Technically, it might not be the only plane that was manufactured in 2013 (ordering does not indicate distinct values), but there is definitely no older plane.

3322 is the number of planes that flew from NYC and are included in the planes table (we used semi_join to reduce the planes table). However, it is precisely the same number that the whole planes table has - meaning that planes table is made of planes that flew from NYC.

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

    -   What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
    -   For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.

For some reason, R does not calculate the median for arr_delay variable in summarize section. I have used multiple ways to get to the result, but the problem seems to be narrowed down to non-calculating median value.

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

Only 5 carriers fly to SFO, with United Air Lines Inc. making most flights (6819), but Virgin America focusing on San Francisco destination most (42.6% of its flights).

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))
```
:::


*I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.*

I believe that the graph is a bar chart on absolute number (not percentage) of cancellations by month, faceted by carrier (vertically) and airport of origin (horizontally). To build this graph, we would need the following:

1.  Filter for only "SFO" airport in "dest" variable to get only flights to San Francisco
2.  Filter for only NA values in dep_time to get only cancelled flights
3.  Group by carrier, origin (airport of origin) and month
4.  Summarize (count) number of cancelled flights in each group with n()
5.  Plot the bar chart with x = months and y = count
6.  Facet graphs by carrier and origin
7.  Another feature of graph is label the value in each bar - probably, some additional method in ggplot2 library.

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

The website https://hollywoodagegap.com is a record of *THE AGE DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/ graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical' `age_difference` in movies?

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:


$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$ How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?

-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?
-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests in this dataset?
-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years (1935 - 2022)?
-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Render the edited and completed Quarto Markdown (qmd) file as a Word document (use the "Render" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be commiting and pushing tour changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
